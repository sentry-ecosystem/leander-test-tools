# Sentry Test Tools (Leander)

A repo of error generating projects to debug sentry locally.

## About This Repository

This repository contains local test tools for generating errors in Sentry during development and testing. These are standalone applications that can be run locally against your Sentry instance (local development, getsentry, or sentry.io).

**Note:** This repository does NOT contain the source code for external test generators like error-generator.sentry.dev. Those are hosted separately and generate their own test errors in their respective environments (e.g., Vercel Edge Functions).

## Flask-Error

A small project useful for generating errors in a flask project. 
Set it up with `make setup` and `make install`.
Run it with `python app.py [sentry | getsentry | hosted]`, and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/error](http://127.0.0.1:5000/error) to trigger server errors.

Defaults to `sentry` as the error location (local development on `getsentry/sentry`). `getsentry` points to `getsentry/getsentry` development. `hosted` points to `sentry.io`.

## React-Error

Automated error generation in a react project. Useful for generating many events on a single issue with a variety of tags unique properties.
