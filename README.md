# Sentry Test Tools (Leander)

A repo of error generating projects to debug sentry locally.

## Flask-Error

A small project useful for generating errors in a flask project. 
Set it up with `make setup` and `make install`.
Run it with `python app.py [sentry | getsentry | hosted]`, and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/error](http://127.0.0.1:5000/error) to trigger server errors.

Defaults to `sentry` as the error location (local development on `getsentry/sentry`). `getsentry` points to `getsentry/getsentry` development. `hosted` points to `sentry.io`.

## React-Error

Automated error generation in a react project. Useful for generating many events on a single issue with a variety of tags unique properties.

## Lumon Terminal

A Severance-themed Flask API with 30 deterministic, realistic failures for Sentry Autofix, Seer, and VS Code extension demos. See [`lumon-terminal/README.md`](lumon-terminal/README.md) for setup, configuration, and the suggested demo flow.
