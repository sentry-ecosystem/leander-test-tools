# Sentry Test Tools (Leander)

A repo of error generating projects to debug sentry locally.

## Important Note

This repository generates specific test errors for local Sentry development and testing purposes. If you encounter errors from external sources (e.g., errors generated by `error-generator.sentry.dev` or errors with transaction patterns like `test-transaction-*`), those are NOT generated by this codebase. This repository only contains:
- Flask-Error: A Flask application that generates ZeroDivisionError when accessing `/error`
- React-Error: A React application for automated error generation

## Flask-Error

A small project useful for generating errors in a flask project. 
Set it up with `make setup` and `make install`.
Run it with `python app.py [sentry | getsentry | hosted]`, and go to [http://127.0.0.1:5000/error](http://127.0.0.1:5000/error) to trigger server errors.

Defaults to `sentry` as the error location (local development on `getsentry/sentry`). `getsentry` points to `getsentry/getsentry` development. `hosted` points to `sentry.io`.

## React-Error

Automated error generation in a react project. Useful for generating many events on a single issue with a variety of tags unique properties.
